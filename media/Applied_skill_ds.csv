Topic,Description
SQL and Python,"SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It is widely used in data science to extract data, run queries, and perform data analysis. Python is a versatile and powerful programming language that is widely used in data science. It includes libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn that enable data scientists to perform data manipulation, data analysis, and machine learning tasks. Python is also used in building data pipelines and web applications. Understanding Python and its data science libraries is a key component of a successful data science career."
Basic Math (LA),"Mathematics is an essential part of data science. It includes topics such as linear algebra, calculus, statistics, and probability. These topics help data scientists understand the underlying mathematical concepts behind machine learning models and data analysis techniques."
Data Visualization,"Data visualization is the graphical representation of data and information. It is used to communicate complex data in an easy-to-understand format. Data visualization tools such as Matplotlib, Tableau, and D3.js can help data scientists create effective visualizations."
Machine Learning,"Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on building algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. It includes topics such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning."
Text Processing(NLP),"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling machines to understand and interpret human language. It includes topics such as text processing, sentiment analysis, and language translation."
Mlops,MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a practice for collaboration and communication between data scientists and operations professionals to help manage the production lifecycle of machine learning models. It is usually found in organizations that have implemented machine learning solutions for their business processes.
